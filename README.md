# Mascarpone 🧀

**Interactive CLI tool for scaffolding Tiramisu game projects**

Named after the Italian cream cheese used in tiramisu, Mascarpone provides a delightful TUI experience for creating new game projects with the Tiramisu game engine.

## Installation

```bash
gleam add mascarpone
```

## Usage

Run the interactive project creator:

```bash
gleam run -m mascarpone
```

The TUI will guide you through:

1. **Project Name**: Enter a name for your game project
2. **Lustre Integration**: Choose whether to include Lustre for UI overlays (menus, HUDs, etc.)
3. **Project Template**: Select from:
   - **2D Game** - Orthographic camera and sprite setup
   - **3D Game** - Perspective camera with lighting
   - **Physics Demo** - Physics-enabled objects

## What It Creates

Mascarpone generates a fully-configured Tiramisu project with:

- `gleam.toml` with all necessary dependencies
- `.gitignore` for Gleam projects
- Main source file with a working game example
- Lustre dev tools configuration (if selected)
- Three.js and Rapier3D CDN imports (via import maps)

## Example

```bash
$ gleam run -m mascarpone
